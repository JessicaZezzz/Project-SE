            <p>One of the most sought after scholarships to study in the UK among the Indonesian students is the Chevening Scholarship. This scholarship is a master's scholarship from the British Government and is well known among scholarship fighters, especially those who want to continue their studies in the UK. The Chevening Scholarship provides a variety of benefits to its candidates. Including the cost of full education in the UK with a relatively short duration of study, which is 1 year. Therefore, this scholarship has a fairly tight competitiveness. In order to pass, there are a number of tips that you can apply. Here are the things that prospective applicants need to prepare.</p>

            <p><b>1. Having work experience </b> <br> 
               Chevening scholarships are intended for undergraduates who already have work experience, or have focused on a particular field.  This is because Chevening wants candidates who already have clear goals and plans, so that in the future they can immediately apply their knowledge. Candidate must have a minimum of 2800 hours of work experience. This number of working hours can come from work that is full time, part time, volunteer, or internship. </p>

            <p> <b>2. Achievement </b> <br> 
                Having work experience alone is not enough to be accepted as a Chevening scholarship awardee.  Candidates must also prove their leadership abilities or spirit. How to prove it? The candidate's leadership spirit will be assessed based on his track record of involvement in a project.  It is even better if the candidate is the leader of a project in their workplace or community. </p>

            <p> <b>3. Prepare documents carefully Next are tips that you must do before registering. </b> <br>
                Documents required to apply for this scholarship are 2 letters of recommendation from superiors and lecturers, copies of diplomas, transcripts,  Letter of Acceptance (LoA), 4 essays, and TOEFL/EILTS certificates. However, since 2020, due to the Covid 19 pandemic, candidates are not required to include a TOEFL/EILTS certificate. Don't forget that all documents must be in English. Candidates can use the services of a sworn translator for official documents.
            </p>  
            
            <p> <b>4. Consider the chosen major and university seriously </b> <br>
                While preparing the required documents, candidates can simultaneously think about the major and university to be chosen. The scholarship provides an opportunity for candidates to choose 3 universities and 1 major in each university. Candidates should think seriously about their major. Well, many think that candidates must choose a major that is linear with their undergraduate level. It's not wrong. It would be better if the candidate's choice of S2 major is linear with his S1 major. However, in fact, choosing a different major can be done. The reference for choosing a major is the field or profession that the candidate is currently pursuing. The point is how the chosen major can support candidates to develop more in the profession they are involved in. So candidates must be smart to associate their chosen major with their future goals. Candidates with a good explanation of how their chosen major can help and support them in achieving their goals, will have a greater chance of being accepted. 
            </p>

            <p> <b>5. Write a good essay </b><br>
                When registering on the Chevening scholarship registration portal, candidates will be faced with 4 essay columns related to a predetermined topic. The four topics asked about leadership, networking, preferred majors, and career goals. In the leadership column, candidates can share their experiences as leaders, either in the world of work or in other activities. When writing, candidates can tell the obstacles or obstacles they have passed, along with how they overcome these obstacles. Next is the topic of networking. Here the candidate can explain how they build relationships and the expectations/goals they want to achieve with the ability to build networking. For essays on the topic of their chosen major, candidates can write the reasons they chose their major, as discussed in the previous sub-heading. The last is the topic related to career goals. This topic is related to the major you have chosen. However, here you can explain more about your plans after completing your studies in the UK and returning to Indonesia. 
            </p>

            <p><b>6. Preparing for the interview</b><br>
                The final tip is to prepare for the interview. Taking an interview can be very intimidating, so it is not uncommon for candidates to feel so nervous that they have difficulty answering questions properly. That's why interview preparation is very necessary. This preparation can be in the form of interview exercises as well as making estimates of answers for interviews. The Chevening Scholarship interview was attended by 3 panelists who were representatives of the British embassy, ​​the Chevening committee, and Chevening alumni. During the interview, the panelists will ask what was written in the essay during registration. Panelists may also ask the candidate's personal and professional aspirations, as well as the reasons for how Chevening can help the candidate achieve his goals in the future.
